# ModelBuilder + Python - Two Peas in a Pod

As presented at the 2020 Ohio GIS Conference

See additional details in `ModelBuilder + Python - Two Peas in a Pod.ipynb`

## Abstract

When it comes to developing geoprocessing pipelines, [ArcGIS ModelBuilder](https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/analyze/modelbuilder/what-is-modelbuilder.htm) and [Python](https://www.python.org/) are a combination that can't be beat! In this workshop we will describe how to build a geoprocessing pipeline that leverages the flexibility of Python and its [panoply of packages](https://pypi.org/) while retaining the simple and familiar ModelBuilder user interface. As an example, we'll walk through a hybrid model/script that downloads U.S. Census data via the [Census API](https://www.census.gov/data/developers.html), performs some simple manipulations of the data, joins it to geography polygons (also automatically downloaded from the Census website), creates a map, and publishes via [ArcGIS Online](https://www.arcgis.com/). Attendees will learn about the complementary strengths and weaknesses of Python and ModelBuilder, how to use Python to fetch U.S. Census data and prepare it for use in ArcGIS, and how to incorporate Python code in a ModelBuilder model as a script tool. Attendees should have some familiarity with ModelBuilder. Familiarity with Python is helpful, but not required.
